George Stephans (PhD U Pennsylvania) is a Senior Research Scientist in the Laboratory for Nuclear Science and a Senior Lecturer in the Physics Department at MIT. His research work involves collisions of very high energy atomic nuclei. The goal of these studies is to understand the behavior of systems of sub-atomic constituents (quarks and gluons) at extremely high temperatures and densities. His most recent experiments use the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. He has decades of experience teaching physics at MIT.

Anna Frebel is the Silverman ('68) Family Career Development Professor and Assistant Professor in the Astrophysics Division of the Physics Department at MIT. Originally from Germany, she received her PhD from the Australian National University's Mt. Stromlo Observatory. Frebel joined the MIT physics faculty in 2012. She has taught Astrophysics and Classical Mechanics, and mentors research students. Her research focuses on the oldest stars in the universe and the early evolution of the chemical elements. Frebel also enjoys communicating science to the public, lately through her popular science book "Searching for the oldest stars: Ancient Relics from the Early Universe".
