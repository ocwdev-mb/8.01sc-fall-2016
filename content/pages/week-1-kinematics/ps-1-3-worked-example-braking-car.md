At time \\(\\displaystyle t=0 \\), a car moving along the +\\(\\displaystyle x \\)-axis passes through \\(\\displaystyle x=0 \\) with a constant velocity of magnitude \\(\\displaystyle v\_0 \\). At some time later, \\(\\displaystyle t\_1 \\), it starts to slow down. The acceleration of the car as a function of time is given by:

{{< tableopen >}}
{{< tropen >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
\\(\\displaystyle a(t) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 0 & \\quad 0 \\leq t \\leq t\_1 \\\\ -c(t-t\_1) & \\quad t\_1 \\lt t \\leq t\_2 \\end{array} \\right. \\)
{{< tdclose >}}

{{< tdclose >}}

{{< trclose >}}

{{< tableclose >}}

where \\(\\displaystyle c \\) is a positive constants in SI units, and \\(\\displaystyle t\_1 \\lt t \\leq t\_2 \\) is the given time interval for which the car is slowing down. The goal of the problem is to find the car's position as a function of time between \\(\\displaystyle t\_{1} \\lt t \\lt t\_2 \\). Express your answer in terms of v\_0 for \\(\\displaystyle v\_0 \\), t\_1 for \\(\\displaystyle t\_1 \\), t\_2 for \\(\\displaystyle t\_2 \\), and \\(\\displaystyle c \\) as needed.

**(Part a)**. What is \\(\\displaystyle v(t) \\), the velocity of the car as a function of time during the time interval \\(\\displaystyle 0 \\leq t \\leq t\_1 \\)?

**(Part b)**. What is \\(\\displaystyle x(t) \\), the position of the car as a function of time during the time interval \\(\\displaystyle 0 \\leq t \\leq t\_1 \\)?

**(Part c)**. What is \\(\\displaystyle v(t) \\), the velocity of the car as a function of time during the time interval \\(\\displaystyle t\_1 \\lt t \\leq t\_2 \\)?

**(Part d)**. What is \\(\\displaystyle x(t) \\), the position of the car as a function of time during the time interval \\(\\displaystyle t\_1 \\lt t \\leq t\_2 \\)?
