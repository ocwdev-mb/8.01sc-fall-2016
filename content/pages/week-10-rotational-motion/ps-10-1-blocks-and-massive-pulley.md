A pulley of mass \\(\\displaystyle m\_ p\\), radius \\(\\displaystyle R\\), and moment of inertia about its center of mass \\(\\displaystyle I\_{cm}\\), is attached to the edge of a table. An inextensible string of negligible mass is wrapped around the pulley and attached on one end to block 1 that hangs over the edge of the table. The other end of the string is attached to block 2 which slides along a table. The coefficient of sliding friction between the table and the block 2 is \\(\\displaystyle \\mu \_ k\\). Block 1 has mass \\(\\displaystyle m\_1\\) and block 2 has mass \\(\\displaystyle m\_2\\), with \\(\\displaystyle m\_1>\\mu \_ k m\_2\\). At time \\(\\displaystyle t=0\\), the blocks are released from rest. At time \\(\\displaystyle t=t\_1\\), block 1 hits the ground. Let \\(\\displaystyle g\\) denote the gravitational constant.

Find the direction and magnitude of the acceleration of the block 1 hanging over the edge of the table. The positive direction is chosen to be downward.
