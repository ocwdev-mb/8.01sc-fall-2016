Chain Rule of Differentiation
-----------------------------

Recall that when taking derivatives of a differentiable function \\(f = f(\\theta)\\) whose argument is also a differentiable function \\(\\theta=g(t)\\) then \\(f=f(g(t))=h(t)\\) is a differentiable function of \\(t\\) and

\\(\\frac{df}{dt}=\\frac{df}{d\\theta}\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\)

Note that this is only in the case of circular motion, where \\(r\\) is a constant in time. Otherwise, our derivative of \\(f\\) would also have a \\(\\frac{df}{dr}\\frac{dr}{dt}\\) term.

Radians
-------

One way to measure an angle is in radians. A full circle has \\(2\\pi\\) radians. This week, we will use radians to measure the angles, so all angles will have units of radians, angular velocity will have units of radians/s, and angular acceleration will have units of radians/s\\(^2\\). If we multiply these by a distance, such as \\(r\\), the units will be m, m/s, or m/s\\(^2\\).
