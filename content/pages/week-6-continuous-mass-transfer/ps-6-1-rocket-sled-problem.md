A rocket sled can eject gas backwards or forwards at a speed \\(\\displaystyle u\\) relative to the sled. The initial mass of the fuel in the sled is equal to dry mass of the sled, \\(\\displaystyle m\_0\\). At \\(\\displaystyle t=0\\) the rocket sled has speed \\(\\displaystyle v\_0\\) and starts to eject fuel in the forward direction in order to slow down. You may ignore air resistance. You may treat \\(\\displaystyle u\\) as a given constant in the following questions.

**(Part a)** Let \\(\\displaystyle v\_ r(t)\\) be the x-component of the rocket sled velocity, and \\(\\displaystyle m\_ r(t)\\) the mass of the rocket, dry mass and the fuel inside the rocket, at a given time \\(\\displaystyle t\\). Derive differential equation for \\(\\displaystyle v\_ r\\) in terms of \\(\\displaystyle m\_ r\\).

**(Part b)** Integrate the equation you derived for \\(\\displaystyle v\_ r\\) to find the velocity of the rocket sled as a function of mass, \\(\\displaystyle v\_ r(m\_ r)\\), as the rocket sled slows down. Write your answer using some or all of the following: \\(\\displaystyle u\\), \\(\\displaystyle v\_0\\),\\(\\displaystyle m\_0\\), and \\(\\displaystyle m\_ r\\).

**(Part c)** What was the initial speed \\(\\displaystyle v\_0\\) of the rocket sled if the sled came to rest just as all the fuel was burned? Write your answer using some or all of the following: \\(\\displaystyle u\\), \\(\\displaystyle m\_0\\), and \\(\\displaystyle m\_ r\\).
